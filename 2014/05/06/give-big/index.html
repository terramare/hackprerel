  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Today is the Seattle Foundation&#39;s Give BIG campaign! The Foundation will amplify gifts made today with its matching pool, and each hour, one donor will win a $1000 raffle ticket. It&#39;s a good day to make a difference!</p>

<p>If you participated in the Hack to End Homelessness and were inspired by our collaborators&#39; work, please share this message with your friends and followers!</p>

<p>If you were not able to participate in the weekend but still want to make a difference, we encourage you to consider making a gift to one of our awesome partners:<p>
