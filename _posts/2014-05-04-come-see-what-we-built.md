Hey everybody! Just wanted to let you know we have about 45 tickets still available for tonight's finale. Our teams have been working on some incredible stuff -- everything from an app for data collection about street homelessness to a social network for low-end mobile phones. We'll also have some delicious grub from Lovage and DRY. soda. Join us at 5:00 pm TONIGHT, Impact Hub Seattle in Pioneer Square, 220 2nd Ave S. http://hack2endhomelessness.eventbrite.com.
