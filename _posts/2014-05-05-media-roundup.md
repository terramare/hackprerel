Thanks again to all our amazing participants for the inspiring work you did this weekend! We are working to get <i>all</i> the projects showcased on the home page, but in the meantime, we thought you would enjoy seeing a roundup of our media coverage. It's not all 100 percent accurate, but hey - together, we learned a lot about homelessness in Seattle, inspired people to take action, and built some really cool stuff, and we think that came through in the coverage. Congratulations again!
