Today is the Seattle Foundation's Give BIG campaign! The Foundation will amplify gifts made today with its matching pool, and each hour, one donor will win a $1000 raffle ticket. It's a good day to make a difference!

If you participated in the Hack to End Homelessness and were inspired by our collaborators' work, please share this message with your friends and followers!

If you were not able to participate in the weekend but still want to make a difference, we encourage you to consider making a gift to one of our awesome partners:<p>

Architect Rex Hohlbein serves those who walk through his doors in Fremont every day, rallies the community to support their individual needs, and advocates for a broader shift in the way we view people experiencing homelessness.
