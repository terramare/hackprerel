Hey everyone! We hope you noticed our new <a href="http://www.hacktoendhomelessness.com/projects/">"Completed Projects"</a> tab, which features your slide decks and all your names. We want to make sure all of you get credit for the amazing work you did this weekend. <p>

On that note, we're adding to our local media coverage with comprehensive reports of our own:
<ul>
<li>Catherine Hinrichen from Seattle University just posted a Storify roundup of our finale from Sunday, which you will find <a href="https://storify.com/hinrichc/hack-to-end-homelessness-finale-may-4-2014-seattle">here</a>.</li>

<li>Our friends at YWCA Firesteel also made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x91JRh44-SY">this cool video</a> with Mark Horvath, where he talks about Seattle (and starts talking about us at about 3:15). It's no coincidence the solutions to homelessness are being discovered here!</li>

<li>Rex St. John, who worked on the We Count app, also wrote an <a href="http://masherydev.tumblr.com/post/84931030952/hack-to-end-homelessness-impact-hub-seattle">awesome feature</a> for the MasheryDev Tumblr, and Michael B. Maine's pro photos from our event are <a href="http://michaelbmaine.com/hack2end">here</a>.</li>

<li>Our fearless designers, McKenna Haley (who also worked on our pre-event posters and postcards) created a <a href="https://storify.com/MacHaley/hack-to-end-homelessness-2014?utm_campaign=website&utm_source=email&utm_medium=email">Storify</a>.</li>

<li>CodeFellows did an awesome <a href="- check it out!">writeup</a> as well. Check it out!</li>
</ul>

<strong>Have you published something about the event? Do you plan to? Let us know and we'll feature it in later roundups. Stay tuned!</strong>
