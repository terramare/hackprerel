    <h2>About the organizers</h2>

<h3>Candace Faber</h3>

<p><em>Overall Project Manager</em></p>

<p>I am a communications strategist with a background in global public affairs with the Department of State. My company, Whoa! Strategies, is based at Impact Hub Seattle in Pioneer Square.</p>

<p><strong>Why I’m doing this:</strong> Here in Pioneer Square, we are surrounded by brilliant technologists and innovative thinkers, as well as compassion-driven organizations that work tirelessly to end homelessness. After learning from those professionals that it is indeed possible to end homelessness and that technology can help, I threw myself into organizing this initiative.</p>

<h3>Ethan Phelps-Goodman</h3>

<p><em>Technology Lead</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m a software developer who&#39;s alternated between working in industry, academia and non-profit public interest work. I was a lead developer for three years at the open government group Sunlight Foundation.</p>

<p><strong>Why I’m doing this:</strong> I&#39;m motivated to address housing and homelessness in Seattle by seeing how poorly these issues have been handled in San Francisco. The inequality, disillusionment and suffering in San Francisco should be a warning to us of the dangers of poor policy and lack of resources. I want the Seattle tech community to set the standard for constructive engagement in housing and homelessness.</p>

<h3>Catherine Hinrichsen</h3>

<p><em>Community Lead</em></p>

<p>I’m the project manager for the Project on Family Homelessness at Seattle University. I’ve been a communications professional for 25+ years.</p>

<p><strong>Why I’m doing this:</strong> Until I started working on my Seattle U project four years ago, I had no idea there were children who were homeless. Now I know that there are more than 30,000 just in our state. As a mom, that deeply troubles me and spurs me to action: I want every child to have a safe, stable place to sleep, so they can be healthy, thrive in school and succeed in life.</p>

<h3>Aparna Rae</h3>

<p><em>Event Manager</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m a veteran of the non-profit sector with a passion for impact. I have launched several projects, including programs at Neighborhood House and the social good startup Project Feast. </p>

<p><strong>Why I’m doing this:</strong> I see homelessness all around me. The treatment of homeless individuals and myths around the causes of homelessness is truly dehumanizing. Changing this image is what calls me to Hack to End Homelessness.</p>

<h3>Peter Kittas</h3>

<p><em>Co-organizer / Data Herder</em></p>

<p>I am an independent web developer and system administrator with an extensive background in IT infrastructure management at Adobe Systems.</p>

<p><strong>Why I’m doing this:</strong> I believe having a home is the foundation for a strong and just society. I&#39;m involved with this initiative because I think the data we&#39;ve gathered, powerfully communicated, can help motivate our societal will towards building solutions to homelessness. Yes, homelessness can, for the most part, be solved.</p>

<h3>Sol Villarreal</h3>

<p><em>Hackathon Emcee</em></p>

<p>I&#39;ve always loved talking to people--from walking around my neighborhood as a kid selling candy for fundraisers to giving my third Ignite talk earlier this year--and I&#39;ve been lucky enough to get paid to do what I love over the course of my career in sales, political organizing, and local government.</p>

<p><strong>Why I&#39;m doing this:</strong> I&#39;m a big believer in the benefits of getting more Seattle technologists involved in public policy, and I think the Hack to End Homelessness model is a great way to make meaningful progress on that front.</p>
