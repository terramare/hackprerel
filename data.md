The American Community Survey from the US Census Bureau has extensive data that could be relevant to several projects. Interactive searches can be done from [American FactFinder](http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t) and bulk downloads can be found [here](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data_documentation/data_via_ftp/). These datasets can be very unwieldy if you've not worked with them before, so please talk to Ethan at the hackathon for assistance extracting the data you are looking for.
